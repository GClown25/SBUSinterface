# SBUSinterface
This project consists of a small C module to communicate with SBUS-compadible receivers. 
The example implementation is for a Atmega4809 MCU.

# Hardware 

## Receiver
For the RC receiver, a **TBS crossfire Nano RX** is used. This receiver
can be configured to use non-inverting-sbus, which is needed for the UART peripheral of the MCU.
